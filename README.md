# Soko Number Game Solver

Welcome to the Soko Number Game Solver repository! This project focuses on implementing smart search algorithms to solve the Soko Number puzzle game.

## Game Description

Soko Number is a single-player puzzle game that challenges players with logical problem-solving. The game is played on a grid containing numbered and empty squares. The goal is to guide numbered boxes to their corresponding numbered squares, ultimately completing each level. Notably:

- The game comprises 25 levels of increasing complexity, althougt 6 are implemented in the project due to hardware constrains.
- Some empty squares possess correct numerical values upon first contact.
- Movement is restricted to pushing boxes in the bottom, right, and left directions.
- Boxes move collectively until they hit a wall, demanding strategic planning to organize and relocate them effectively.

## Algorithms Implemented

Three smart search algorithms were implemented to tackle Soko Number's puzzles:

1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
2. Depth First Search (DFS)
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
